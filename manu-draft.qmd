## Abstract

Native habitats in Florida face dual pressures at the land-sea interface from urban development and sea-level rise associated with climate change. To address these pressures, restoration practitioners require robust tools that identify reasonable goals given historical land use trends, current status of the habitat mosaic, and anticipated future impacts from coastal stressors. A target-setting approach for native habitats was created for the Tampa Bay watershed that identifies current restoration opportunities and establishes short (2030) and long-term (2050) goals. The approach was informed through a three-decade habitat change analysis and over forty years of habitat restoration experience in the region. Restoration goals were defined based on what is possible today and the projected needs for the future, rather than attempting to replicate past ecological conditions. The new paradigm also accounts for the expected impacts of sea-level rise, climate change, and watershed development - stressors which are pervasive in Florida. The resulting habitat goals are spatially explicit with maps that identify remaining restoration and conservation opportunities, while also providing an approach for the entire watershed that targets subtidal, intertidal, and coastal uplands. This approach represents a general framework to support coastal planning decisions that need to address competing interests and could be applied in other coastal settings where sustainable urbanization practices need to co-exist with natural environments. Methods for repeatable analyses are also available using an open source workflow to update progress over time and for adoption by others.

## Introduction

The health of estuarine systems and coastal habitats is inextricably linked to land uses and management of the watershed [@Yoskowitz15]. Coastal habitats provide multiple ecosystem services, including wildlife shelter and migratory corridors [@Yoskowitz15], fisheries production [@Houde93], water quality improvement [@Kushlan90; @Sprandel00; @AvilaGarcia20], erosion and flood attenuation [@Calil15; @Menendez18], carbon sequestration [@Dontis20] and recreation [@Chung18]. Pervasive stressors can negatively impact the services provided by these habitats. Anthropogenic land development can remove or substantially modify existing habitats, and can alter hydrology of nearby streams and rivers [@Theobald97; @Sim14]. Related changes in habitats in response to climate change (sea-level rise and warming) include landward migration of mangroves into salt marshes, upstream migration of salt marshes within tidal tributaries, and upland forest migration [@Brinson95; @Vogelmann12; @Cavanaugh19]. Management of coastal habitats requires an understanding of how stressores impact these resources, while balancing competing societal uses.

The combined effects of land development and climate change are especially problematic for prioritizing habitat restoration or conservation activities in coastal environments. Landward migration of critical habitats in response to sea-level rise may not be possible due to anthropogenic barriers in the watershed. Sea-level rise can occur quicker than landward migration of salt marshes and the upland slope may already be lost to urban development and hardening [@Titus09]. The coastal squeeze of development and climate change diminishes the available space for future restoration in urban estuaries, thereby impacting the variety of ecosystem services provided by these habitats and the wildlife they support [@Enwright15]. Given projected habitat losses without management intervention and the limited resources available (i.e., time, land, funding, and labor force), appropriate and realistic sites for restoration need to be identified that account for future stressors and past trends.

Past approaches for guiding restoration planning have been successfully used in other contexts, but they do not fully balance competing needs among public and private sectors, nor do they fully account for anticipated effects of multiple stressors. For example, an integrated watershed approach [@EPA96] has been utilized since the early 1990s to diagnose and manage water quantity and quality problems by addressing issues within hydrologically-defined geographic areas. Additionally, the habitat mosaic approach [@Henningsen05] of including multiple habitat types within restoration projects has been recognized as an effective means of allowing ecosystem state changes in response to different environmental pressures [@Duarte09; @Palmer09]. Adaptive management [@Holling78; @Gregory06] components have been increasingly used to address challenges of sea-level rise, climate change, and development stressors, including monitoring to identify critical restoration decision points and needed intervention with contingency plans. Elements of each of these approaches could be combined to create a more holistic approach to guide restoration and conservation activities for coastal habitats in urban settings.

The Tampa Bay watershed (Florida, USA) is a valuable case study for developing a habitat restoration and conservation plan that addresses pervasive coastal stressors. Compared to other estuaries, the ratio of watershed to estuary area is small and the area is heavily developed with 42% of land use classified as urban and suburban residential [@SWFWMD18]. A retrospective approach to setting habitat protection and restoration targets in Tampa Bay was previously employed [@Lewis96; @Robison10; @Cicchetti11; @Russell15]. Priority was given to restoration activities focused on habitat types that were important for a suite of estuarine faunal guilds disproportionately lost or degraded compared to a benchmark period. Criticisms of this approach included a lack of consideration for future sea-level rise and other climate change factors [@Yoskowitz15], use of expanded and different habitats outside the Tampa Bay watershed [@Robison10], lack of attention to upland or freshwater wetland habitats, and little recognition of land development trends or actual available space for restoration efforts. These challenges are shared by restoration practitioners in other coastal environments and an approach that accommodates these challenges for planning would be highly transferable.

This paper describes an approach for habitat restoration and conservation planning that addresses the above challenges by considering the whole watershed, addressing historical changes, focusing on trajectories that have occurred during contemporary time periods, and considering both current and future stressors -- particularly land development and sea-level rise. Relatively consistent data are available for most Tampa Bay habitats of interest (1988 to 2018), representing a time period when federal, state and local regulations were in effect and regional impacts from climate change are documented [@Raabe12; @Cavanaugh14]. The approach establishes a framework that can guide both watershed-level habitat planning and site-level restoration activities and incorporates applicable elements of other habitat restoration paradigms discussed above [@Palmer09]. The general approach includes 1) designation of habitat types by strata relative to the aquatic-terrestrial gradient, 2) quantification of historical trends by habitat types to identify appropriate future targets in coverage, and 3) identification of opportunity areas that could be used by practitioners to achieve restoration goals based on habitat type and past trajectories. The outcomes are spatially-specific by providing maps to identity opportunity areas and reproducible using an open science workflow [@Lowndes17] that allows regular updates as new data become available.

## Methods

### Study area

Tampa Bay is a large open water estuary (surface area approximately 983 km^2^) on the west-central coast of Florida (@fig-lulcmap). The watershed covers approximately 5,872 km^2^, for a total combined area of approximately 6,855 km^2^. The climate is subtropical and within the current (2020) ecotone for mangrove and salt marsh habitats. The upstream watershed includes multiple habitats, including pine flatwoods, forested freshwater wetlands and non-forested vegetated wetlands. The watershed is heavily developed with an estimated population of 3.3 million people in the four major counties of the watershed [@Rayer20]*.* Numerous anthropogenic changes have altered the natural habits of Tampa Bay, including direct removal of habitat (e.g., dredge and fill of bay bottom, mining activities), alteration of hydrology, and destruction and fragmentation of habitat from development.

### Habitats of Tampa Bay

The major habitat types of Tampa Bay were stratified relative to tidal influence and location in the watershed. Subtidal habitats included those that are submerged all or most of the time; intertidal habitats included emergent tidal wetlands that are submerged during high tides but exposed during low tides; and supratidal habitats included those that occur above the high tide line (i.e., the remainder of the watershed).

Subtidal habitats included hard bottom [@Jaap90; @Ash05], artificial reefs [@Dupont08], tidal flats [@Eisma98; @Moore68]*,* seagrasses [@Heck03; @Sherwood17], and oyster reefs [@Coen07; @zuErmgassen13]. Intertidal habiats (or emergent tidal wetlands) included mangroves [@Odum90], salt marshes [@Raabe12; @Comeaux12], salt barrens [@Berntness85; @Hsieh04]*,* tidal tributaries [@Sherwood08; @JEI16; @JEI20; @Wessel22], and living shorelines [@Smith18; @NOAA15; @RAE15]. Supratidal habitats included non-developed uplands [@Meyers90], freshwater forested wetlands [@Conner07], and freshwater non-forested wetlands [@Kushlan90]*.* Uplands were further sub-divided into coastal and non-coastal uplands based on location relative to the 5-foot contour that extended landward from the bay shoreline (described below). This 5-foot contour area was considered the most likely to be impacted by sea-level rise based on current estimates. Since 1946, the St. Petersburg tidal gauge (NOAA gauge 872650) has documented a nearly 20 cm increase in mean tidal height to present day. Projections to the year 2100 suggest sea levels can increase from 58 to 259 cm in the region [@tbep0519].

### Approach

Opportunity areas for restoration and recommended coverage targets for habitat types were identified by integrating multiple datasets available for the region. First, habitat status and historical trends were quantified using land use/land cover and subtidal datasets to understand relative changes that have occurred over time. Second, historic habitat restoration efforts conducted in the Tampa Bay watershed were synthesized as a guide for understanding a feasible level of effort for future projects that could be conducted by restoration practitioners. The first two steps were used to identify short-term (2030) goals and long-term (2050) targets for coverage (hectares) of native habitats. Finally, remaining opportunities for restoration were spatially identified by combining current coverages with existing or proposed protected areas and areas anticipated to be impacted by sea-level rise. As such, the approach identifies goals and targets and provides spatially explicit information that identifies where restoration practitioners should pursue projects to meet these goals and targets.

### Habitat status and trends

For the majority of subtidal, intertidal and supratidal habitats, coverages were quantified from two routine spatial assessment programs conducted by the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD). For subtidal habitats, 2018 source data were used to estimate current coverage of seagrasses, tidal flats, and oysters [@SWFWMD19]. Historical datasets for subtidal habitats began in 1988 with updates occurring on an approximate bi-annual basis [@Sherwood17; @Tomasko20]*.* Oyster bed coverage has been routinely estimated in these data products beginning in 2014.

Current intertidal and supratidal habitat coverages were estimated using the 2017 SWFWMD Land Use Land Cover (LULC) geospatial database [@SWFWMD18]. Land use and cover types (natural and developed) are classified pursuant to the Florida Land Use Cover and Forms Classification System [FLUCCS, @FDOT99; @SWFWMD14]*.* Mangroves, salt barrens, and salt marshes were reported individually. While the photointerpretation of specific freshwater wetland types is often difficult, forested wetlands and non-forested wetlands can be distinguished with these data. Therefore, all applicable FLUCCS codes representing the suite of natural freshwater wetlands were combined within those two classifications. Native upland habitats were also combined in one classification. Historical estimates for these habitat coverages were also quantified starting with the earliest database in 1990 and occurring every two to three years until the current estimate in 2017.

To address data gaps for habitats not included in the routine SWFWMD datasets, results from special studies were compiled to obtain current estimates. These included hard bottom subtidal habitats, artificial reefs, tidal creeks, and living shorelines, only available as current estimates with no information on historical trends.

Current and historical coverage estimates were obtained for all habitat types, including estimates of developed lands, for each year of available data spanning approximately three decades at two-year time steps. In addition, a habitat coverage change analysis between the terminal years of data (1988 to 2018 for subtidal, 1990 to 2017 for intertidal and supratidal) was conducted to understand how habitats were changing between types. This required an intersection of the data layers to quantify if habitat types were unchanged or changed for any given location and identifying the type of change (e.g., seagrass to tidal flats). The results were summarized as Alluvial diagrams showing relative proportions of habitat change by type and between years [@Allaire17].

### Restoration and enhancement projects

Past restoration projects were quantified for each of the major habitat types, when available, to inform expectations for setting short-term goals and long-term targets. Information regarding habitat restoration and enhancement activities in the Tampa Bay area over the past 40 years was compiled from various sources.  Restoration was defined as any activity that involved earthwork to reshape the land or the addition of structural elements (e.g., rock). Enhancement was defined as any activity not including earthwork that improved the environment (e.g., planting native vegetation, invasive species or debris removal, prescribed burns, etc.). Data were gathered from the SWFWMD Surface Water Improvement and Management Program, Federal Government Performance and Results Act reporting, the Tampa Bay Water Atlas (<https://www.tampabay.wateratlas.usf.edu/>), Tampa Bay Watch, and the Technical Advisory Committee of the Tampa Bay Estuary Program. The collected data included project name, year, description, size (area or length), and location (latitude and longitude). Data gaps were supplemented by archival research, site visits, contacting the responsible entities, and expert knowledge form local professionals. Living shoreline projects, including seawall enhancements and oyster reef installations, were inventoried separately.

### Opportunity areas and restoration potential

Spatially-explicit estimates of the opportunity areas and their restoration potential in the Tampa Bay watershed were obtained using a spatial analysis shown in @fig-gisworkflow. The two main processes included 1) binning existing datasets into relevant categories and 2) overlaying multiple datasets to identify restoration opportunities. Opportunity areas were defined as locations where habitat protection and restoration activities are possible and where they could occur to attain defined goals and targets. The definition and mapping of opportunity areas is necessary to quantify the restoration potential for a particular habitat type, which is a measure of what is actually possible under current and future projected conditions, related to anticipated land use change and sea-level rise.

The Land Use Land Cover 2017 dataset from SWFWMD was used for binning existing coverages into the relevant habitat types in the intertidal and subtidal strata. All FLUCCS classification codes were placed into one of three categories. First, native habitats were those that included the full range of natural plant communities and other habitats that are endemic to the watershed, and were further grouped into three major habitat types (tidal wetlands, freshwater wetlands, and uplands). Second, restorable habitats included existing altered but non-hardened and pervious FLUCCS codes that could potentially support native habitats through restoration. Third, existing development included developed land FLUCCS codes that are hardened and impervious (e.g., structures and pavement) and not suitable for habitat restoration.

After binning, the native and restorable lands were overlaid with additional layers to identify 1) reservation native and reservation restorable areas, and 2) existing and proposed native and restorable areas. Collectively, each of these unique products are considered the opportunity areas in the Tampa Bay watershed. The reservation native and reservation restorable areas are native and restorable habitats, respectively, that occur in the 5-foot contour or coastal stratum. This area extends from the local Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) elevation to elevation 5 feet above Mean Sea Level and is likely to be affected by frequent tidal flooding or inundation [@tbep0519]. Native habitats in this stratum were identified as those to be reserved, whereas restorable habitats were identified as those where tidal wetlands could be restored.

The existing and proposed native and restorable areas were those that occured in public lands and parcels currently acquired or targeted for acquisition. To identify these areas, native and restorable lands were intersected with data created from the Florida Natural Areas Inventory, consulting staff from various federal, state and local entities, and inventorying conservation and drainage easements data. This workflow created the existing conservation and proposed (i.e., planned to be acquired) conservation layers in @fig-gisworkflow . Intersecting the native and restorable lands in these areas produced four unique opportunity areas: existing conservation native, proposed conservation native, existing conservation restorable, and proposed conservation native.

All opportunity areas identified as restorable included reservation restorable (in the coastal stratum), existing conservation restorable, and proposed conservation restorable. These layers were further grouped into their restoration potential as discrete habitat types that could be the goal of future restoration projects. The restoration potential was defined using the coastal stratum, soil types, and salinities of adjacent waters.

Compared to vegetation communities, soil characteristics typically change slowly (e.g., decades to centuries) in response to hydrologic impacts, unless physically disturbed [@Osland12; @Stockmann14]. Therefore, soil distributions can be used to estimate historical habitat distribution and restoration potential. @Ries14 created a soils suitability analysis for wetland mitigation and restoration and classified all soils in the Tampa Bay watershed as xeric, mesic, or hydric. The mesic and hydric categories were combined to represent wetland restoration potential, while the xeric category was used to represent upland restoration potential.

A distinction was made between tidal and freshwater wetland restoration potential by intersecting the mesic and hydric soils with the coastal stratum. Mesic or hydric soils that occur below the 5-foot contour were assigned a restoration potential for tidal wetlands, while mesic or hydric soils occurring above the 5-foot contour were assigned a restoration potential for freshwater wetlands. A final restoration potential category was created for low salinity salt marshes (*Juncus* spp.) in the coastal stratum. These included restorable lands with mesic or hydric soils and also lands adjacent to waters with average salinity values less than 18 psu [@Eleuterius79]. The salinity values were identified using salinity isohalines created from a long-term water quality data set provided by the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County.

Two distinct mapping products were created from the above analysis. The first was an opportunities map that showed areas in the watershed identified as existing conservation native, existing conservation restorable, proposed conservation native, proposed conservation restorable, reservation native, and reservation restorable. The second was a map that identified the restorable lands (either proposed, existing, or reservation) based on their restoration potential as coastal uplands, freshwater wetlands, native uplands, or tidal wetlands (which included salt marshes). All analyses were conducted using the R statistical programming language [@RCT22], specifically leveraging tools from the tidyverse package for data wrangling [@Wickham19] and the simple features (sf) package for geospatial analysis [@Pebesma18]. The workflows and data are provided in an open-access repository available on GitHub (<https://github.com/tbep-tech/hmpu-workflow>) for use by others [@Beck22].

## Results

### Habitat status and trends

Current estimates and trend information were available for seagrasses, tidal flats, and oyster bars (Table 1). Oyster bars were estimated at 67 ha in 2018 (Table 1), showing a 29% increase since mapping began in 2014.  This increase may represent improved ground-truthing and photointerpretation of oyster bars from aerial photography. Tidal flats have generally increased from 1988 to the mid-2000s, followed by a decrease to present.  The current estimate for tidal flats is 6,569 hectares, showing a 24% decline compared to the 1988 estimate of 8,700 hectares. Seagrasses have increased by 75% since 1988 to a current estimate of 6,986 ha. The change analysis comparing 1988 to 2018 for subtidal habitats (@fig-subtchgdatalluv) confirmed trends in Table 1 and showed that the seagrass increases were primarily associated with the colonization of non-vegetated areas of tidal flats, as well as unclassified areas of open water. Current estimates for subtidal habitats without historical trend information included 171 ha for natural hard bottom and 67 hectares for artificial reefs.

Total intertidal habitat (mangroves, salt barrens, and salt marshes) showed a 12% increase of 835 ha from 1990 to 2017, with a current estimate of 8,340 ha (Table 2). Mangroves increased by 15% to 6,276 ha, salt barrens increased by 7% to 203 ha, and salt marshes increased by 3% to 1,861 ha. Despite a net increase in salt marsh habitat, the change analysis showed that 153 ha were replaced by mangrove habitat (@fig-chgdatalluv). The current extent of tidal tributary length is 622 km (no trend information is available).

Trend assessments for supratidal habitats showed the effects of increasing land development and loss of restorable habitats in the Tampa Bay watershed (Table 2).  Developed lands showed a 44% increase to 217,047 ha from 1990 to 2017, with a notable 30% decrease to 1,446 ha for coastal uplands, a 38% decrease to 57,836 ha for native uplands, and an 18% decrease to 189,512 ha for restorable lands. Non-forested freshwater wetlands showed a 24% increase to 27,358 ha, while forested freshwater wetlands decreased by 5% to 61,667 ha.  The change analysis (@fig-chgdatalluv) showed that a majority of land conversion to developed came from restorable lands (21,292 ha) and native uplands (7,184 ha), with smaller proportions converted from forested freshwater wetlands (1,407 ha) and coastal uplands (193 ha). Habitats converted to restorable primarily included native uplands (8,304 ha), forested freshwater wetlands (1,700 ha), and developed (2,794 ha).  The increase in non-forested freshwater wetlands was primarily from restorable lands (2,759 ha).

### Habitat restoration and enhancement

A total of 460 restoration projects were documented in Tampa Bay and its watershed between 1971 and 2019.  These projects were divided among habitat types that included estuarine (n = 228), freshwater (n = 53), uplands (n = 119), and a mix of all three (n = 60). A total of 1,978 ha have been restored, whereas 12,930 ha and 42.8 km (as shoreline or tributaries) were enhanced. Forty partners were responsible for these projects, although some were from departments within the same agency. Eighty-nine living shoreline projects, seawall enhancements, and oyster reef installations were documented, with a total linear length of 18.2 km.

### Summary of opportunity areas and restoration potential

The map of the remaining opportunity areas provided an areal estimate of where practitioners could target future restoration projects (@fig-oppmap). Native lands (existing conservation native, proposed conservation native, reservation native) totaled `r areas$native$areaha` (`r areas$native$areaper` of the watershed above MLLW).  Similarly, restorable lands (existing conservation restorable, proposed conservation restorable, reservation restorable) totalled `r areas$restorable$areaha` (`r areas$restorable$areaper` of watershed).  Understandably, most of the native and restorable lands occurred in undeveloped areas of the watershed, particularly in the north and southwest. Existing conservation lands (existing conservation native, existing conservation restorable) totalled `r areas$existing$areaha` (`r areas$existing$areaper` of the watershed) and proposed conservation lands (proposed conservation native, proposed conservation restorable) totalled `r areas$proposed$areaha` (`r areas$proposed$areaper` of the watershed).  Reservation areas in the coastal stratum (reservation native, reservation restorable) totalled `r areas$reservation$areaha` (`r areas$reservation$areaper` of the watershed).

Combining the restorable lands in @fig-oppmap with the coastal stratum, soils, and salinity data provided a spatial summary of the restoration potential grouped by habitat type (@fig-restmap).  


Table 3

Integration of all of the opportunity layers provides a summary of the available restoration for the TBEP habitats of interest (Table 5). The "Native Habitats" columns show the total current extent as well as the portion of the current extent occurring on existing conservation lands and proposed conservation lands, respectively. The "Restorable Habitats" columns show the total restoration opportunity as well as the portion of the total restoration opportunity on existing and proposed conservation lands. The majority of restoration opportunities on existing conservation lands are for native uplands and freshwater wetlands (Table 5). However, there are approximately 627 ha of emergent tidal wetland restoration opportunities on existing conservation lands, including 530 ha applicable to higher salinity mangrove forests and salt barrens, and 16 ha applicable to lower salinity salt marsh (e.g., *Juncus roemerianus*) restoration and creation.

The best estimates of total restoration opportunities for urban shorelines and tidal tributaries are provided by the Tampa Bay Living Shoreline Suitability Model (LSSM) prepared by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission [@Boland18]. There is 2,566 km of shoreline in Tampa Bay, and approximately 33% is recommended for living shoreline enhancement.

### Establishment of goals and targets

Table 4

Recommended targets were based on habitat status and trends, habitat restoration data, identified restoration opportunities, and current and anticipated trends in development, available funding, and regulations [@Hilderbrand05; @Hobbs07].

The targets and goals (Table 6) identify where the 2017 CCMP Bay Habitat goals and strategies and the 2021-2025 Strategic Plan [@Burke20] thriving habitats and abundant wildlife programmatic priorities can be implemented. However, it also recognizes that the identified habitat protection and restoration areas will change over time, and will be revisited on a 10-year recurring cycle. A 30-year planning horizon (2050) is also identified based upon sea-level rise projections developed specifically for Tampa Bay [@Burke19]. The coastal stratum (from the existing mean low water line to the approximate 5-foot contour) is projected to directly experience the effects of sea-level rise by 2050, and is the primary focus area for coastal habitat protection and restoration activities. Land acquisition or protection (through conservation easements or other mechanisms) will be needed to ensure completion of targets and goals for both salt marsh and upland habitats (Fig 3).

Targets that maintain current coverage ("hold-the line strategies") were identified for habitats that appear to currently be sustained at acceptable levels. Evolving information such as an Oyster Habitat Suitability Index [@Boswell12] and ongoing mapping exercises will be used to identify optimal locations to conduct restoration activities that help achieve targets and goals. Coordination with the establishment of state-mandated minimum flows [@Munson07] will be necessary for restoration and maintenance of low-salinity salt marsh habitats that will experience higher salinities and rapid transition to mangroves under existing sea-level rise scenarios [@Sherwood14; @Geselbracht15].

## Discussion

Because of multiple stressors such as encroaching development and climate change, habitat protection and restoration priorities should be tempered and "reality tested" by what is actually possible today, and what is possible in the future. Many native and potentially restorable habitats are limited, and there will always be restrictions on the financial resources that can be dedicated to public conservation land acquisition and habitat restoration activities.

This replicable method for setting restoration targets and goals provides a systematic attempt to identify habitat protection and restoration targets that are based on what is actually achievable within those limitations. It focuses on existing opportunities for all habitat types, and what is realistically possible in the future, rather than attempting to mimic previous ecological conditions.

### Habitat trends

When viewed as a whole, the most significant and meaningful trends in the TBEP habitats of interest over the periods of record examined include: 1) the 75 percent gain in seagrasses since 1988; 2) the slight gains in emergent tidal wetlands (10%) and freshwater wetlands (2%) since 1990; and 3) the 39% loss in native upland habitats since 1990.

The intertidal zone in Tampa Bay is currently experiencing dynamic change, driven by sea-level rise and climate change, whereby mangrove forests are outcompeting salt marshes and salt barrens for the available niche space. Without increasing the total area of the intertidal zone, restoring a greater coverage of mangroves would reduce the niche space available for salt marshes and salt barrens. This phenomenon has been observed throughout the Gulf of Mexico, and has been attributed to both climate change (e.g., fewer freeze events) and sea-level rise [@Comeaux12].

The observed gains in wetlands (Table 3b) are likely a reflection of: 1) the effectiveness of state and federal wetland regulatory programs; and 2) the cumulative gains resulting from, primarily, publicly-funded habitat restoration projects (Table 4). Minor gains in some emergent tidal wetlands (e.g., salt barrens) may also be a reflection of the landward expansion of the complex suite of these habitats associated with climate change and sea-level rise. Gains in vegetated non-forested freshwater wetlands are related to the clearing of forested wetlands followed by the creation of herbaceous mitigation areas and stormwater systems.

The decrease in native uplands (Table 3b) is the result of continued development in the Tampa Bay watershed, combined with the lack of regulatory protection of native uplands. Attaining the target and goal will require concerted restoration of native upland habitats on existing conservation lands, as well as new conservation lands to offset the continued loss of these habitats to development, and amendments to existing planning, zoning and land development policies or regulations. While federal and state regulations related to listed species management impart some protection to certain rare habitats, such as scrub jay (*Aphelocoma coerulescens*) habitat, common and historically abundant native habitats, such as pine flatwoods, are left largely unprotected. Unless local governments in the Tampa Bay watershed improve local protections for native uplands, such as strengthening language within comprehensive plans and development ordinances, this trend will likely continue.

### Habitat restoration

Increases observed in tidal and freshwater wetlands are primarily due to publicly-funded habitat restoration projects, state and federal wetland regulatory programs, and to a lesser extent, regulatory mitigation. While restoration activities date to 1971, few projects were completed prior to 1990, and from 1990-2010, an annual mean of 68 ha of habitat was restored. Over the past decade (2010-2019), this rate of restoration project completion has increased to over 81 ha/yr. Assuming that funding levels remain in the same range as the past decade, this annual mean can be used to set reasonable limits on restoration potential and targets.

While existing development areas are not considered feasible for major habitat restoration activities at this time, there are many opportunities to enhance and restore habitat functions and improve coastal resilience in urbanized locations. Examples include the construction of living shorelines, placement of submerged habitat modules along developed urban shorelines and seawalls, and creation of backyard habitats. Tidal tributary restoration could also entail improvements including removal of salinity barriers and filling of dredged channel sections with low dissolved oxygen.

Four major types of disturbed sites around the Tampa Bay coastline have been identified as priority estuarine habitat restoration sites by TBEP stakeholders over the past two decades, including dredged holes, filled and spoil disposal areas, abandoned aquaculture ponds; and coastal borrow pits and stormwater ponds. Substantial opportunities also exist for upland restoration on reclaimed mined lands within the watershed.

There is a general consensus among restoration practitioners and natural resource managers that habitat restoration and management is most cost-effective on publicly-owned conservation lands and provides long-term benefits. Furthermore, given current development trends in the Tampa Bay watershed, public acquisition of remaining critical lands (e.g., coastal uplands, river floodplain wetlands) is a high priority, and some restoration targets (e.g., salt marshes) will not be feasible without additional public acquisition or public-private partnerships [@Holl01; @Benson18]. Therefore, varied approaches to leverage resources, including traditional grants, partner funding, and use of volunteers for habitat restoration are recommended to maximize the potential for successful target and goal achievement.

### Rolling easements, mitigation, and restoration consortium

As discussed, land acquisition for coastal habitat restoration must prioritize adjacent low-lying coastal uplands to serve as buffers to accommodate future landward migration of tidal wetlands in response to sea-level rise. Where public acquisition is not possible, other conservation mechanisms need to be explored. Coastal setbacks, buffers, or public easements are traditionally used to restrict development within a given distance from the shoreline. A rolling easement is a dynamic mechanism that "rolls" landward as sea levels rise and cause tidal encroachments onto low-lying coastal uplands [@Titus09]. The application of rolling easements in Tampa Bay could disincentivize more intense urban development (e.g., discourage up-zoning) of low-lying coastal uplands that may be currently in less intense agricultural or recreational (e.g., golf courses) land uses. Under a rolling easement, landowners would be able to maintain current economic uses, while "reserving" such lands to accommodate tidal wetland migration with advancing sea-level rise.

Wetland impacts and associated compensatory mitigation projects authorized under wetland regulatory programs have historically been conducted independent of watershed-level planning and monitoring processes. This disconnect has contributed to fragmented implementation and inconsistent compliance monitoring of mitigation projects, as well as historically poor documentation of wetland losses and gains in the Tampa Bay watershed. However, if properly focused and comprehensively coordinated, compensatory mitigation activities could significantly contribute to the attainment of wetland habitat restoration goals and targets for the Tampa Bay estuarine system and its contributing watershed.

TBEP will form a public-private partnership to provide the framework for the development of a coordinated approach linking regulatory (compensatory mitigation) and resource management (publicly funded habitat enhancement, restoration, and establishment) programs in the watershed. The creation of the Habitat Management Consortium is expected to provide benefits such as optimizing and improving the cost-effectiveness of habitat protection, restoration and mitigation activities in the watershed.

### Conclusion

The establishment of targets and goals considering climate change, development, land availability, and past achievements, expands the restoration palette to a more comprehensive list of habitats within the system. If successfully implemented, the 2050 goals would total over 4,000 ha of habitat restoration throughout the Tampa Bay watershed. Land acquisition will be an important component of successful completion of different targets and goals, including the salt marsh restoration target for the first ten years. Land acquisition will also provide new opportunities for outdoor access, given that these projects often have a public recreation component.

Our new approach will continue to engage multiple partner agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private citizens in the successful implementation of the restoration plan. Emphases will include recognition of land types particularly vulnerable to climate change or development stressors and these needs will be communicated to restoration partners. Consistent education, targeted funding opportunities, and reporting will also ensure that these newly established targets and goals lead to successful restoration projects, land acquisition, and enhanced ecosystem services.
